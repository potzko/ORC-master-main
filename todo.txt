important additions:

Implement temporary variable counting to avoid saving all registers to the stack in case I don't need to when I call a function.
Implement external function calls (mostly for free and malloc).
AST optimizer: Check for pure functions and run them at compile time.
Constant fold more aggressively (transitive operations come to mind).
IR compiler: Create an IR optimizer, remove extra temporary variables as a start.
IR asm compiler: Create a small ASM optimizer (pinhole optimizations look like a good start).

Small additions:
Refactor to use enums rather than strings.
